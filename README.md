Lists of MTG cards for various purposes

## Details

These lists are often in custom formats that are meant to be read by a tool I've written. These custom formats provide additional information alongside the card, like the Scryfall id for a particular version of the card, or which border it uses. In most cases this information can be stripped out easily if you want to use the card lists for something and need a standard MTGO or MTGA-like format.
